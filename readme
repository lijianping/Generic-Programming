The generic programming can help to achieve a common library of standard
containers.
In this project, I will using C language achieve the single list, double
linked list which can operation on a variety of data types.

The directory structure like this:
Greneric-Programming
     /-- src
		/-- single_list
	 /-- test
	 readme

The src directory contains the implementation code.
The single_list directory contains the single list implementation code.
The test containers a simple test code.
The readme introduces the project.
